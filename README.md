1Password client for linux

## why

This adds support for the new [OPVault](https://support.1password.com/opvault-design/) data format and has basic support for the 1Password browser extension.

## install

Build the gtkmenu using `./build-gtkmenu.sh` and run using `node 1pass`

## run

Use --prompt for command line mode. Or no option to start browser extension mode.

You have to locate your current working directory, where the 1Password folder is (the *.opvault is in this folder)

```bash
~/workspace/onepass$ node 1pass.js --prompt
info: Unlocking vault...
Password:
Keychain unlocked.

Keyword: gmail
